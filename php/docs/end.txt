- The unique worker code is generated using SHA1 encoding on the subject id and an independent word.

HTML
- A small button with a hyperlink to the detailed instructions (instruction/instruction.php) is shown in the upper right corner.
- A thank you text is displayed and the unique worker code is displayed with a small button to ease the task. 
- A link to a forum thread where feedback can be given is listed.

Javascript
- A small script handles the prompt to copy the code.
